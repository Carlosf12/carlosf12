**Important considerations:**

1.  **Image Hosting:** Make sure you create an `images` folder in the root of your repository and place all the logo images there.
2.  **Image Paths:** Ensure that the image paths in the Markdown are correct relative to the `README.md` file.
3.  **Replace Placeholder:** Remember to replace `YOUR_LINKEDIN_PROFILE_URL` with your actual LinkedIn profile URL.
4.  **Image Sources:** Find high-quality logos for each technology. You can use official websites, Devicon, or Simple Icons as sources.
5.  **Alt Text:** While the images are displayed, it is still best practice to add alt text to the images, so that accessibility tools can describe them. Example: `![Node.js Logo](images/nodejs-logo.png "Node.js Logo")`
